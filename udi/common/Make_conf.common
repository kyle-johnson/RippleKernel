# This is a make configuration file which supplies the generic configuration
# information for this make operation and then invokes the proper environment
# configuration file for the detailed build information.  The caller invokes
# make on the standard Makefile which sets the appropriate variables and then
# includes this make configuration file.  The make variables set by the
# invoking makefile are:
#    INDIR  = (TOPDIR relative) directory to do actual make in when configured
#    TOPDIR = relation of INDIR to the top of the source tree
#    OBJDIR = (INDIR relative) directory to build objects in
# The current directory when performing this operation is assumed to be
# the INDIR location.
