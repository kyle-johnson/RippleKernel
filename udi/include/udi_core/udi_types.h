 * udi_types.h contains the only public definitions for UDI drivers that
 * may need to be provided differently on different classes of platforms.
 * The definitions below for the fixed-length types will only work with
 * ILP32, LP64 and P64 data models. Once the ISO C fixed-length types
 * are defined (in the C9X rev of the ISO C standard), this udi_types.h
 * can be made even more portable by defining the UDI types in terms of
 * the ISO C fixed-length types.
 * 
 * However, the definitions of the abstract types can still be different
 * on different platforms.  Typically these definitions will vary based
 * on processor data word size and platform constraints, so it's expected
 * that most 32-bit platforms could all have the same definitions for
 * the abstract types; similarly for 64-bit systems.
 *
 * Given the above it would appear likely that we can provide a single
 * udi_types.h file that works correctly for most 32-bit and 64-bit
 * platforms.  Other size platforms, or specialized platforms, may need
 * to create their own udi_types.h.
 * 
 * Binary Portability
 * -------------------
 * UDI drivers are by definition completely source-code portable and
 * are binary portable within a given ABI (Architected Binary Interface).
 * An ABI is determined by several factors: the ISA (Instruction Set 
 * Architecture), endianness, data model (e.g. 32- vs. 64-bit), data
 * structure alignments and sizes, calling conventions, and the UDI API
 * definitions. By defining data type sizes, this file is providing
 * some aspects of an ABI binding, whether defacto or corresponding to
 * an actual ABI specification.
