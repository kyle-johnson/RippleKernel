Ripple Kernel
-------------

This is a sad excuse for a version controlled tree of source for a sad excuse for a kernel I coded between 2002 - 2003. I believe at some point I started saving source in CVS, but I'm unsure what happened to that; this tree was pieced together through ZIP backups.

My recollection is that the floppy driver never worked and the memory manager might've had some major bugs.

Best to ignore this code really, it's just here for... well, I don't quite know why I put this up. :)
